# js-google-maps-api-route-planner
Plans a circle route through bus stops depending on given waypoints

So, my wife works at school and once she had to plan bus driver route
in order to drive all the children who wanted it to school. 
We did it through google maps, but then I figured, maybe I can use google maps api 
and make an app that will be only about planning this route.


User gives list of addresses in simple text file, line under line. 
Script takes that list, and finds nearest bus stops, so that the driver doesn't need to drive through small alleys, 
and finally script calculater the route using google maps api of course.


Firstly I started with javascript, not very happy about that, 
but determined to make it work. Maybe later I'll try with Java, saw they have that api too.
